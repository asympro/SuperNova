# Supernova RFQ Bot
This is a Python-based Telegram bot for processing cryptocurrency trading requests. The bot can interpret "request for quote" (RFQ) messages sent in plain text, process trades and provide RFQ responses. It interacts with Binance's spot market to provide real-time price and size information. It uses GPT-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI to parse and understand the RFQs.

## Modules
The bot is organized into several modules:

chat_bot.py: This is the main script for the bot. It handles the startup, and sets up the commands and responses for the bot. It also provides the main function to start the bot.
positions.py: This module is responsible for managing the bot's current positions in various cryptocurrencies.
rfq_processor.py: This module is responsible for processing RFQs. It communicates with the Binance connector and the chatgpt module to parse and understand the requests, and calculate prices.
trade_processor.py: This module is responsible for executing trades based on the RFQs and user instructions.
chatgpt.py: This module uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to parse and understand RFQs based on certain instructions.
Environment Variables
SUPERNOVA_BOT_KEY: Your Telegram bot token, which can be obtained by creating a new bot on Telegram via BotFather.
OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key, which is used for the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
## Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands:

/start: Initiates the bot.
/kill: Shuts down the bot.
/rfq: Processes an RFQ. The RFQ details are expected to be passed in as command arguments.
/trade: Executes a trade. The trade instructions are expected to be passed in as command arguments.
Running the Bot
Ensure that the environment variables SUPERNOVA_BOT_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY are set in your environment. Then you can start the bot by running the chat_bot.py script:

## bash
```
python chat_bot.py
```
## Example Usage
After initiating the bot with the /start command, you can send an RFQ such as "/rfq 100 BTC". The bot will then provide a quote for buying or selling 100 BTC.

To execute a trade, you can use the /trade command, for example "/trade mine" to execute a buy trade.
